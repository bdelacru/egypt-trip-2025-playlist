    lyrics: `1. [O Lord Jesus, I've been lost
Christ, I seek to be with You
Purify me, at all costs
And teach me what is true

My Lord Jesus the helper
Come O Lord do not delay
Be my shield and protector
Show me my Lord the true way]

R: [Lord I’ve strayed I’ve lost my way
My sins are overwhelming me
Come visit me every day
And heal the pain inside of me]x2

2. [The comfort of all weary souls
The hope of those in agony
The One who makes the broken whole
And sets all the captives free

Hold me close when tears do fall
Take me in Your loving embrace
I am Your child, through it all
Guide me always by Your grace]

R: [Lord I’ve strayed I’ve lost my way
My sins are overwhelming me
Come visit me every day
And heal the pain inside of me]x2

3. [Father accept my contrition
Cleanse me and make me unblemished
You forgive without condition
And restore what sin diminished]x2

R2: [Lord You’ll stay even with my ways
My sins won’t overpower me
You are with me all my days
You’ve healed the pain inside of me]x2`

    lyrics: `What's your impossible? Your "I need a miracle"
What's got you barely hanging by a single thread?
What looks so hopeless now? What weighs down your heart with doubt?
You beg for a breakthrough, but no sign of breakthrough yet
When you've cried, and you've cried 'til your tears run dry
The answer won't come, and you don't know why
And you wonder if you can bow your head even one more time
Don't stop praying
Don't stop calling on Jesus' name
Keep on pounding on Heaven's door
And let your knees wear out the floor
Don't stop believing
'Cause mountains move with just a little faith
And your Father's heard every single word you're saying
So, don't stop praying
He's close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit
The Alpha and Omega knows how your story ends
When you've cried, and you've cried 'til your tears run dry
The answer won't come, and you don't know why
And you wonder if you can bow your head even one more time
Oh, do it one more time
And don't stop praying
Don't stop calling on Jesus' name
Keep on pounding on Heaven's door
And let your knees wear out the floor
Don't stop believing
'Cause mountains move with just a little faith
And your Father's heard every single word you're saying
So, don't stop praying
Oh-oh
(Don't stop, don't stop praying) oh, don't stop praying
(Don't stop, don't stop praying)
Oh-oh
Don't stop praying for the prodigal
Don't stop praying for the miracle
Hallelujah, hallelujah, and amen
Don't stop praying that addictions end
Don't stop praying for deliverance
Hallelujah, hallelujah, and amen
Oh, don't stop praying for the sickness healed
Don't stop praying for His power revealed
Hallelujah, hallelujah, and amen
No, don't stop praying for the Kingdom come
Don't stop praying that His will be done
Hallelujah, hallelujah, and amen
Don't stop praying
Don't stop calling on Jesus' name
Keep on pounding on Heaven's door
Let your knees wear out the floor
Don't stop believing
'Cause mountains move with just a little faith
And your Father's heard every single word you're saying
So, don't stop praying
oh, don't stop praying
(Don't stop, don't stop praying) hey, don't you give up now
No, don't stop praying`
